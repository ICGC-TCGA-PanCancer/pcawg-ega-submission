study_abstract: >
  The Pancancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) study is an international
  collaboration to identify common patterns of mutation in more than 2,800
  cancer whole genomes from the International Cancer Genome Consortium.
  Building upon previous work which examined cancer coding regions (Cancer
  Genome Atlas Research Network, The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer analysis
  project, Nat. Genet. 2013 45:1113), this project is exploring the nature
  and consequences of somatic and germline variations in both coding and
  non-coding regions, with specific emphasis on cis-regulatory sites,
  non-coding RNAs, and large-scale structural alterations.
